<h3><ins> My journey to freshworks </ins></h3>

<p>
On that time of searching for colleges,I saw the video of prem sir on <b>LMES academy youtube channel</b> about the impactful initiative by <b>freshworks (fssa)</b> for the students who can't afford for quality education.
And then I wrote the FSAT and got selected in freshworks software academy.

<p>
I didn't ever thought that the youtube social media app which I loved the most and spend my most of the time is going to change my life but,it is...
</p>

<p>
Today, I am here as a freshworks student learning new things every single day from the experts,collegues and by myself. 
It is one of the biggest decisions which I made in my carreer to come to freshworks. 
I am sure that I will utilize this opportunity to the fullest.

<h3> <ins>My dreams</ins> </h3>

<p>
As so many of the people in India, I am also one of them who are struggling with money. 
from my childhood itself, Money is a big obstacle in my life but I want to Break that...I want to start a business that provides value to the people and to experience that entrepreneur life atleast once in my lifetime.

<p>
My biggest dream is that I want to <b>LIVE MY LIFE</b> with not worrying about money and to make this possible for others also.
